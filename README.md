# CMOS_PLL_Design-
This PLL design uses standard logic in the PFD and VCO, with a high-speed PMOS/NMOS cascode in the CP for low mismatch current and high output impedance. The DIV leverages Folded MOS Current Mode Logic (FMCML) to optimize bias currents, reducing delay and power in the divide-by-2 cell.
